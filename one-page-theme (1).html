                <Java> <b> <H1> Java </H1></b> <p>JAVA is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]
        
                    Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
                    
                    As of March 2023, Java 20 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.
                    Applications of Java
                    Mobile Applications
                    Desktop GUI Applications
                    Artificial intelligence
                    Scientific Applications
                    Cloud Applications
                    Embedded Systems
                    Gaming Applications</p>
                   <p> James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[25]
        
        Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[26] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[27] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.
        
        In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[28][29][30] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[31] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
        
        On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[32]
        
        Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist.[33] Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency.[34] This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section).
        
        On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.[35]</p>
        
       <p> In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.[36]
        
        Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers.[37]
        
        Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to unresolved security issues in older versions.
        Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:
        
        Java Card for smart-cards.[43]
        Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) – targeting environments with limited resources.[44]
        Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) – targeting workstation environments.[45]
        Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.[46]
        The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.
        
        Sun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile pairings.

        Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
        Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
        Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
        Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.
        Python Online Compiler/Interpreter
        We have provided Python Online Compiler/Interpreter which helps you to Edit and Execute the code directly from your browser. Try to click the icon run button to run the following Python code to print conventional "Hello, World!".
        
        Below code box allows you to change the value of the code. Try to change the value inside print() and run it again to verify the result.
        # This is my first Python program.
        # This will print 'Hello, World!' as the output
    </p>
       <p> print ("Hello, World!");

        It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
        Applications of Python
        The latest release of Python is 3.x. As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:
    </p>
       <p> Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
        Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
        Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
        A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
        Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
        Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
        Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
        Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
        GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
        Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

                <P>1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database 
                MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).
                
                Why use MongoDB? 
                
                Fast – Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.
                Scalability – Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
                Use of JavaScript – MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.
                Schema Less – Any type of data in a separate document.
                Data stored in the form of JSON –
                Objects, Object Members, Arrays, Values, and Strings
                JSON syntax is very easy to use.
                JSON has a wide range of browser compatibility.
                Sharing Data: Data of any size and type(video, audio) can be shared easily.
                Simple Environment Setup – Its really simple to set up MongoDB.
                Flexible Document Model – MongoDB supports document-model(tables, schemas, columns & SQL) which is faster and easier.
                Creating a database: Simply done using a “use” command:
                use database_name;
                Creating a table: If the collection/table doesn’t exist then a new collection/table will be created:
                db.createCollection("collection_name");
                Inserting records into the collection:
                db.collection_name.insert
                (
                    {
                        "id" : 1,

                    }
                );

                <P>2. Express: Back-End Framework: 
                Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Express supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.
                
                Why use Express? 
                
                
                Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
                Efficient, fast & scalable
                Has the biggest community for Node.js
                Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
                Robust API
                Create a new folder to start your express project and type below command in the command prompt to initialize a package.json file. Accept the default settings and continue.
                npm init
                Then install express by typing the below command and hit enter. Now finally create a file inside the directory named index.js.
                npm install express --save
                
                
                Now type in the following in index.js to create a sample server.
                const express = require('express'),
                http = require('http');
                 
                const hostname = 'localhost';
                const port = 8080;
                const app = express();
                 
                app.use((req, res) => {
                  console.log(req.headers);
                  res.statusCode = 200;
                  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
                  res.end('<html><body><h1>This is a test server</h1></body></html>');
                 
                });
                const sample_server = http.createServer(app);
                 
                sample_server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
                  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
                });
                Update the “scripts” section in package.json file
                
                
                Then to start the server by running the below command
                npm start
                
                
                Now you can open the browser and get the output of the running server.

                <P>3. React: Front-End Library 
                React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavaScript and create UI components. 
                
                Why use React? 
                
                Virtual DOM – A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes the entire UI to re-render the virtual DOM. Then the difference between the original DOM and this virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to the original DOM.
                JSX – Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React components.
                Components – ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.
                High Performance – Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.
                Developing Android/Ios Apps – With React Native you can easily code Android-based or IOS-Based apps with just the knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS.
                You can start your react application by first installing “create-react-app” using npm or yarn.
                npm install create-react-app --global
                OR 
                
                yarn global add create-react-app
                After that you can create a new react app by using.
                create-react-app app_name
                Then navigate into the “app_name” folder and type yarn start or npm start to start your application.
                
                
                A typical React application looks like this:
                
                
                Update index.js file
                ReactDOM.render(
                  <h1>Hello DEVELOPERS!!</h1>,
                  document.getElementById('root')
                );
                
                
                Use the below commands to run your application.
                npm start
                or 
                 
                
                yarn start
                
            </P>
                <P>4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment 
                Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download. 
                
                Why use Node.JS? 
                
                Open-source JavaScript Runtime Environment
                Single threading – Follows a single-threaded model.
                Data Streaming
                Fast – Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
                Highly Scalable
                Initialize a Node.js application by typing running the below command in the command window. Accept the standard settings.
                npm init
                Create a file named index.js. 
                Example: 
                A basic Node.js example to compute the perimeter & area of a rectangle.
                var rectangle = {
                    perimeter: (x, y) => (2*(x+y)),
                    area: (x, y) => (x*y)
                };
                 
                function Rectangle(l, b) {
                    console.log("A rectangle with l = " + l + " and b = " + b);
                 
                    if (l <= 0 || b <= 0) {
                        console.log("Error! Rectangle's length & breadth should be greater than 0:  l = "
                               + l + ",  and b = " + b);
                    }
                    else {
                        console.log("Area of the rectangle: " + rectangle.area(l, b));
                        console.log("Perimeter of the rectangle: " + rectangle.perimeter(l, b));
                    }
                }
                 
                Rectangle(1, 8);
                Rectangle(3, 12);
                Rectangle(-6, 3);
                Run the node application by running the below command in the command window.
                npm</P>

            A relatively new stack, MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. MEAN is an end-to-end JavaScript stack largely used for cloud-ready applications. Understanding why you might use it, identifying examples of when to employ it, and diving deeper into the individual components can help you maximize the value of MEAN for software development.
        
            Benefits of MEAN stack
            When building an application from scratch, employing a consistent, standardized software stack is vital. Creating your backend with a set of tools designed to work together reduces development time and streamlines resources.
            
            However, the stack field is getting crowded. From LAMP to Ruby on Rails, there are a number of options. Each stack has its benefits and downsides and is geared for different projects. There’s no one-size-fits-all stack for development.
            
            MEAN is an open source web stack that is mainly used to create cloud-hosted applications. MEAN stack applications are flexible, scalable, and extensible, making them the perfect candidate for cloud hosting. The stack includes its own web server so it can be deployed easily, and the database can be scaled on demand to accommodate temporary usage spikes. A MEAN application enters the world optimized to take advantage of all the cost savings and performance improvements of the cloud.
            
            JavaScript has long been a popular language for front-end web development—it’s flexible, dynamic, and easy to use. But it has been an option only for backend and database development for a few years, allowing developers to create applications using end-to-end JavaScript. Because every part of MEAN uses the same language, you can streamline your development teams. MEAN removes the need to hire different specialists to develop each part of an application. Instead, you can use a single pool of JavaScript developers to work adaptively, where and when needed. Standardizing on JavaScript also provides an opportunity to reuse code across the entire application, reducing unnecessary reinvention. 
            
            MEAN stack use cases
            While the MEAN stack isn’t perfect for every application, there are many uses where it excels. It’s a strong choice for developing cloud-native applications because of its scalability and its ability to manage concurrent users. The AngularJS frontend framework also makes it ideal for developing single-page applications (SPAs) that serve all information and functionality on a single page. Here are a few examples for using MEAN:
            
            Calendars
            Expense tracking
            News aggregation sites
            Mapping and location finding
            MEAN stack components </P>

            MongoDB
            MongoDB is an open source, NoSQL database designed for cloud applications. It uses object-oriented organization instead of a relational model.
            
            In the MEAN stack, MongoDB stores the application’s data. Because both the application and the database use JavaScript, there’s no need to translate the object as it journeys from the application to the database and back. The application can push and pull objects between the back end and the database without missing a beat.
            
            MongoDB is touted for its scalability in both storage and performance. You can add fields to the database without reloading the entire table, and MongoDB is well known for its ability to manage large amounts of data without compromising on data access. With just a few clicks, you can expand the resources available to your database, making it perfect for applications with occasional periods of increased activity.
            
            For a deeper dive into MongoDB, see "MongoDB: An Essential Guide."
            
            Express
            Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It balances ease of use and a full feature set.
            
            Forming the backend of the MEAN stack, Express handles all the interactions between the frontend and the database, ensuring a smooth transfer of data to the end user. It’s designed to be used with Node.js and so continues the consistent use of JavaScript throughout the stack.
            
            Express is minimalist—it’s designed to efficiently handle processes without cluttering your application. But don’t confuse minimalist with featureless. Express offers excellent error handling and templating functionality to aid your development.
            
            Express can also protect you from yourself because it uses the CommonJS module standard to prevent inadvertent overwriting of variables within the shared namespace. You can’t accidentally redefine a variable that you previously created. This enforcement of JavaScript closures can help prevent a time-consuming and costly error.
            
            AngularJS
            AngularJS—Google’s JavaScript frontend framework—isn’t the only frontend framework in use, but it’s exceedingly popular. It is effectively the default for frontend JavaScript development. If you’re developing a web application in JavaScript, you’re using AngularJS.
            
            The MEAN stack includes AngularJS to help developers build the user-facing side of the application. Because the backend, frontend and database are all built on JavaScript, there’s a smooth flow of information between all parts of your application.
            
            AngularJS didn’t become the most popular JavaScript frontend framework by mistake. Its ability to simultaneously develop for desktop and mobile use, its well-tuned performance and its easy-to-use templates make it the ideal front end to build cloud-native applications.
            
            Node.js</P>
            <P>            Node.js is an open source JavaScript framework that uses asynchronous events to process multiple connections simultaneously. It is an ideal framework for a cloud-based application, as it can effortlessly scale requests on demand. You’re likely to find Node.js behind most well-known web presences.
            
            Node.js is the backbone of the MEAN stack. Express is purpose-built to work on top of Node.js, and AngularJS connects seamlessly to Node.js for fast data serving. Node.js comes complete with an integrated web server, making it easy to deploy your MongoDB database and application to the cloud.
            
            The greatest strength of Node.js is its scalability. Cloud applications are best when they can respond quickly to usage spikes. What good is virtually unlimited processing power if it’s only available after your users time out? By expanding your resources as they’re needed, you’re able to serve more users while the framework’s single-thread architecture allows the application to effectively provide a smooth user experience across numerous connections. Node.js can support as many as a million simultaneous connections.
            
            Remember, Node.js works best with many low-resource requests as opposed to resource-intensive requests. While a single thread protects against process deadlocks, it’s not immune to a large process freezing the system for all clients.
